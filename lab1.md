Lab 1
=====

### Due Friday, August 26, 2016 - 5:00pm

The goals of this assignment are the following:

- Prepare your Java development environment
- Familiarize you with the submission procedure
- Implement your first Java program!


##Requirements
1. Part 1 (5 points): Prepare your development environment.
  1. Activate your account on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/usfca/fall2016/cs112/home). 
  2. Download the [Java Development Platform](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Note that this is **not** just the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
  3. Download a text editor. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is recommended. 
  4. Prepare your SVN repository following these instructions: [SVN Guide](https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/svn_guide.md). 
  5. Create a ```lab1``` directory in your SVN repository.

2. Part 2 (10 points): Create a class ```PrintDiamond``` in the ```lab1``` directory. The main method of the ```PrintDiamond``` class will print the following diamond shape:

 ```
       *
      * *
     * * *
    * * * *
     * * *
      * *
       *
 ```
 - Do not print any unneeded characters. No string should be longer than it has to be.
 - You are *not* expected to use iteration (loops) in your solution.

3. Part 3 (10 points): Create a class ```Initials``` in the ```lab1``` directory. The main method of the ```Initials``` will print your initials in block letters similar to the following:

```
	SSSSSS     NN   NN     RRRRRR
	SSSSSS     NN   NN     R    R
	S          NN   NN     RRRRRR
	SSSSSS     NNN  NN     RR    
	SSSSSS     NN N NN     R R   
	     S     NN  NNN     R  R
	SSSSSS     NN   NN     R    R
	SSSSSS     NN   NN     R     R
```
 
### Submission Requirements

Follow the instructions in the [SVN Guide](https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/svn_guide.md) for submitting your solution by the deadline.

For this assignment, you will submit only one file, ```PrintDiamond.java```.

Make sure you have submitted your work in an SVN directory: ```https://www.cs.usfca.edu/svn/<username>/cs112/lab1```

1. Activate your account on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/usfca/fall2016/cs112/home). 

2. Download the [Java Development Platform](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Note that this is **not** just the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

3. Download a text editor. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is recommended. 

4. Prepare your SVN repository following these instructions: [SVN Guide](https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/svn_guide.md). 

5. Create a ```lab1``` directory in your SVN repository.

6. Create a class ```PrintDiamond``` in the ```lab1``` directory. The ```PrintDiamond``` class will print the following diamond shape:

 ```
       *
      * *
     * * *
    * * * *
     * * *
      * *
       *
 ```
 - Do not print any unneeded characters. No string should be longer than it has to be.
 - You are *not* expected to use iteration (loops) in your solution.
 
 
7. Follow the instructions in the [SVN Guide](https://github.com/CS112-F16/notes/blob/master/svn_guide.md) for submitting your solution by the deadline.
